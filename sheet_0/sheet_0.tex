\section*{Solutions to Exercise Sheet 0}

\subsection*{Exercise 1 – Are Software Engineers Managers?}
\begin{itemize}
\item The software development is almost always done in a team. 
Effective teamwork can bring great results, but it needs to be well organized. 
The communication between the members of a group, a proper distribution of work, 
setting priorities or time scheduling are responsibilities of a project manager. 

Why is the work distribution important?
A proper work distribution can increase the productivity and improve the quality of out coming product. 
There are few common mistakes that can be done:
\begin{itemize}
\item not knowing or not paying attention to the abilities and key skills of team members. 
This could lead to time waste and frustration among the developers.
\item On the other hand not providing the less experienced employees new challenges. 
A good manager should give the team members a possibility to develop themselves, 
otherwise people can lose the interest in work.
\item To give too much work to the most productive, most experienced or most responsible member of a team. 
An overworked employee would not do his best, would feel stressed and used, and it would spread the rest of the team.
As we see the work distribution can be a challenging task that requires not only management or executive skills, 
but also understanding of the capabilities and psychology of team members. 
\end{itemize}
This problem is not specific to software development, 
however it is applicable and very important for people working in IT.

Why 'normal' managers couldn't do this:
Experience in managing would be beneficial to this, but in software development it is especially critical
to have at least some knowledge of the tasks one distributes to others. For example it can be harmful to
the development process if managers don't understand the real value of testing or underestimate the cost
of implementing a feature.

\item Managing the interaction between different Software components (eg. libraries etc.)
Defining the project boundaries can be a challenging task. 
For software development it is essential to determine the standards of the work,
APIs, code quality, architecture and to manage resources(e.g. time, money, RAM, CPU-Power). 
This has to be done by a project manager. However this management activity requires knowledges 
and experience in computer science. Technical limitations has to be considered. 
Unreasonable time demands for example or money limitations can lead to degradation of the quality 
or in the worst case to not accomplishing the task, which is waste of time and money.

\item Good software reflects to domain it tries to solve.
Most software is developed for other industries than our own. So developer have to understand the domain they are working in. We can't build a banking software without understanding how accounting works.
To achieve this communication with domain experts is essential. 
Although translation between different teams/ departments is a typical management activity in software development it requires a requires a thorough understanding of our industry.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Exercise 2 – Does Software Reliability Matter?}

The heartbleed bug

The heartbleed bug was a vulnerability introduced to the Codebase of OpenSSl in December 2011. Since March 2012, affected Versions of OpenSSL allowed atackers to extract information from RAM which was often used before to store private keys and other important information.

The Vulnerability was caused by the implementation of a the 'heartbeat', which is usually used to determine wether a TSL-encrypted connection to a server is still usable and the other partner is responding. This should have been done by sending a message and getting the same content of it back, but the message 

The damage which was caused is not excatly known, because


Provide a general description of the case, followed by a more detailed description of the software-
related issue and its consequences.
 Quantify the damages caused and argue why the case is relevant.
Discuss in how far the incident (following official reports, or in your opinion) is related to issues with
requirements, design, quality assurance, management, or usage under specified conditions.

\section*{Survey}

\subsection*{1. Expectations}
Our expectations in Softwaretechnik course are:
\begin{itemize}
\item to understand the process of software production
\item Learning more about General Planning as well as
Specific to Software Development
\item to gain knowledge in requirement analysis, process scheduling,
organization, resource distribution, design and testing
\item to learn how to use basic and maybe some advanced techniques,
models and patterns in software development
\item learn the modern techniques of software engineering (agil instead of waterfall), e.g. DDD, TDD, BDD
\item getting to know valuable Design-Patterns
\item to see a focus on software architecture (more than just some design patterns)
\item to focus deeper on software architecture in General
\item to get smarter
\item have fun
\item think about Software in a more General way
%\item getting tools for Attacking Problems with the help of Software
\end{itemize}

We think that this will help us with our career because management experience (even if only in theory) can help in any job. And for a programmer it is good to have an overview of the entire process one is working in. For coding projects one is doing as a hobby, which sometimes can be good for a portfolio, it is good to to know what (not) to do, and how to work efficiently. And getting better at problem solving, working as a team and having fun just makes studying (and later on working) easier.
