Manager:
* Mehr über die Projekte, als über die Aufgaben


IT-only:
* Scrum. (e.g. Scrum-Master, Manage Team assigned tasks, etc)
* Managing the interaction between different Software components (eg. libraries etc.)
    the hard task being defining project boundaries (correct encapsulation).
    defining standards for your work, for APIs, Code Quality, StyleGuide, Architecture
    Checking and Managing resource requirements of projects (e.g. Time, Money, RAM, CPU-Power)
* communication between domain experts / outside world and developer team
    When developing software for a buisness it is essential that the software reflects the buisness.
    To do so, experts and developers have to agree on a common language


Since we are usually working in a team it is always required to somehow manage that.
There are of course different types, because some work in different code-fragments.
Managing between those is critical.
