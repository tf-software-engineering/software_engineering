Here are three different Interpretations of the sentence:

The game must collect and display at least 5 different statistics.


Interpretation 1:
    The game collects statistics about the users progress and behaviour,
    and will make them available through either showing it in-game or
    through sharing it on facebook or other social media.


Interpretation 2:
    There will be collected a lot of information about the behavior of
    the application, like memory usage or CPU-utilarisation, effective
    multicore-usage or GPU-load and settings.


Interpretation for the Originality Challenge:
    We consider, that the statistics to be collected is a questionnary
    with several questions (at least 5), which have to be answered by
    every player. The questions should ask for how much the player liked
    the game and (maybe) some (private) information about him if he wants
    to share. Those statistics would then be send to the developers and
    might be displayed in a nice fashion for them (within their part of
    the game).
