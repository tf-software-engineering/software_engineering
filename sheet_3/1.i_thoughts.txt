game
what part of the program?  
collect
The whole In-Game time or just at startup? who should collect? The renderer...?
display
where should it display? In a pause menu, an own interface, on facebook?
different statistics
should the statistics be for the player (individually), or the developer (accumulated, broader analytics)?
if for the player, do they need to be relevant? Should they differ in the area where they
are collected or can they be derived from a single or two values?

question regrading different:
Should the statistics differ in the their topic, eg. should they be closely related
or cover broader area? How many of them should relate to the players individual 
activity, and how many different statistics are we (the developers) allowed to collect?
