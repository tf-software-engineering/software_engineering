The game must collect and display at least 5 diï¬€erent statistics.

Conditions to clarify:

1. Where the statisics is displayed: in game window, in internet (like how many players there are, or who has the highest score).
2. Different statistics or different types of statistics?
3. What kind of statistics : for player (like the score, energy level, number of lifes, money),
for developer (wich errors and how many, how many times failed, how much of ram the game takes for different levels, etc.),
some web statistics (if the game is web-based, like how many people entered and did not start to play, how many people stopped
after the first level, from wich contries, the best score, the number of current players.), maybe some markrting stats ( 
like wich character have been chosen often, wich design, if you can change it)
4. Collect the statistics: only for current game, or save in database?
5. Should the statistics of players be opened for other players?
6. Should there be a tool to build some graphs/diagrams of collected statistics?

Originality challange: 

We consider, that the statistics to be collected is a questionnary with 5 questions, that has to be answered by every player.
Questions like: did you like the game? Do you think pink for the design is a good idea? etc.
For each question there would be 5 stars, 0-star for not at all, 5-stars for yes absolutelly.
this statistics would be sent each developer per email to inform the participants wether the users liked the game or not.
