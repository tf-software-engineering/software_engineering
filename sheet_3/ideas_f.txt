Here are some different Interpretations of the sentence:

The game must collect and display at least 5 different statistics.


Points you could interpret in different ways:
The game:
    Either the statistics could be about in-game events or the like,
    or about the environment of the game, namely the application itself.
    So we could collect runtime (CPU load, GPU load, memory, distribution, ..)
    statistics or those about the game itself, e.g. Player statistics, or
    simply about the game-mechanics, timing or the like.

collect:
    This appears to be unambiguous, but it could refer to collecting them
    only during execution, meaning losing them after closing the application,
    or saving them for further use/analysing

display:
    This could refer to a variarity of things, namely:
    Show them during the game or directly after, visible for the player
    or only for the developer, show them only on the server or for each
    of the players. And: in what form, as an table with 3 fields or as
    a beatiful graphics?

at least 5:
    okay this is pretty straightforward, but would it hinder us doing
    several hundreds of different statistics?

different:
    Different in what? In what they represent, in how they represent, in
    from what basis they represent, in what color they are?

statistics:
    This could be some (tablerized) file with information or some log from
    events happened in the game, in what form is it supposed to be and
    what would count? A pure log already or does it need to be plottable?
    How extensive does it have to be? Does the one displayed have to be
    dependent on the collected data?
